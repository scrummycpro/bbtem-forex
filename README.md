# Trading Bot Summary GUI

This project is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to help users calculate and display a trading strategy summary for the EUR/USD currency pair. The GUI allows users to input current, upper, lower, and average prices, as well as a stop-loss value and select a time frame (4hr or 8hr). The application then calculates buy and sell entries, limits, and stops, and provides a detailed summary of the trading strategy.

## Features

- Input fields for current, upper, lower, and average prices
- Input field for stop-loss value
- Dropdown menu for selecting the time frame (4hr or 8hr)
- Calculation of buy and sell entries, limits, and trailing stops
- Detailed output of the trading strategy, including risk/reward ratio
- Scrollable interface to accommodate detailed output
- Display of current date and time

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - tkinter
  - matplotlib
  - numpy

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the required Python libraries if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

3. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

2. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python trading_bot_summary_gui.py
```

3. The GUI window will appear with the following elements:
   - Input fields for "Enter Current Price," "Enter Upper Price," "Enter Lower Price," and "Enter Average Price."
   - An input field for "Enter Stop Loss."
   - A dropdown menu for "Select Time Frame" with options "4hr" and "8hr."
   - A "Calculate Strategy" button to perform the calculations.
   - A display area showing the current date and time.
   - A scrollable area for the detailed trading strategy summary.

4. Enter the appropriate values in the input fields and select the desired time frame.

5. Click the "Calculate Strategy" button to generate the trading strategy summary.

6. The detailed summary will be displayed in the scrollable area, showing the calculated buy and sell entries, limits, and trailing stops, as well as the risk/reward ratio and setup instructions.

## Code Overview

The script consists of the following main parts:

1. **Imports and Initialization**:
   - Importing necessary libraries (`datetime`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `tkinter`, `ttk`).
   - Setting the initial data and currency pair.

2. **Function to Calculate Trading Strategy**:
   - The `calculate_strategy` function takes user inputs, performs calculations to determine buy and sell entries, limits, and trailing stops, and updates the summary label with detailed results.

3. **Creating the GUI**:
   - Setting up the main window with a title that includes the currency pair.
   - Creating a scrollable main frame using `tkinter.Canvas` and `ttk.Scrollbar`.
   - Adding input fields for prices and stop-loss, and a dropdown menu for selecting the time frame.
   - Adding a button to trigger the calculation of the trading strategy.
   - Displaying the current date and time.
   - Setting up the layout and ensuring all elements are properly displayed and scrollable.

## Notes

- The script currently only supports the EUR/USD currency pair, but it can be easily modified to support other pairs by changing the `Pair` variable and adjusting the calculations accordingly.
- The detailed output provides setup instructions for using Bollinger Bands with specified periods and deviation, making it easier for users to implement the strategy.
